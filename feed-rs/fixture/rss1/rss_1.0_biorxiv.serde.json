To gain insights into the genetic basis of fungal virulence and host specificity, we sequenced the genome of an isolate from M. sativa using long-read (PacBio) technology. The resulting genome assembly has a total length of 51.7 Mb and comprises 10 core chromosomes and two accessory chromosomes, all of which were sequenced from telomere to telomere. A total of 15,631 gene models were predicted, including genes encoding potentially pathogenicity-related proteins such as candidate secreted effectors (484), secondary metabolism key enzymes (110) and carbohydrate-active enzymes (619). Synteny analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements in the genome of Cd relative to the closely-related Brassicaceae pathogen, C. higginsianum. In addition, a 1.2 Mb species-specific region was detected within the largest core chromosome of Cd that has all the characteristics of fungal accessory chromosomes (transposon-rich, gene-poor, distinct codon usage), providing evidence for exchange between these two genomic compartments. This region was also unique in having undergone extensive intra-chromosomal segmental duplications. Our findings provide insights into the evolution of accessory regions and possible mechanisms for generating genetic diversity in this asexual fungal pathogen."},"categories":[],"contributors":[],"published":"2023-12-16T00:00:00Z","source":null,"rights":null,"media":[],"language":null,"base":null}]}
