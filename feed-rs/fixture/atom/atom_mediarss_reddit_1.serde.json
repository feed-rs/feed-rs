Now my home lab is still fairly new so I don&#39;t have any battery backups installed, so I&#39;ve been looking around at getting a few. I know at work we usually use a 2500VA one for the servers, but I don&#39;t think I need that big of one, I hope. I would love to get a couple of rack mounted ones to save some space, but right now it&#39;s mostly price that I&#39;m worried about. I&#39;ve also been looking at getting/replacing the batteries with Lithium ones, but am having a hard time finding a solution that would work.</p> <p>My lab consists of the following:</p> <p>- Dell R730XD 24 bay + 2 bay in the back, 2x 2690v4, 2x 750w PS. On average it seems to use about 220w-250w, on start up, I think it uses about 500-600w.<br/> - Dell R630 10 bay, 2x 2680v4, 2x 750w PS, it uses similar wattage as the 730<br/> - Cisco 3650 48port switch, it uses about 120w<br/> - 5x Misc devices ranging from 10w-40w</p> <p>My main concerns are the R730XD and the switch.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking on Amazon at an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/APC-Battery-Protector-BackUPS-BX1500M/dp/B06VY6FXMM/ref=pd_bxgy_sccl_2/147-9580957-3644042?pd_rd_w=hpRrH&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.26a5c67f-1a30-486b-bb90-b523ad38d5a0&amp;pf_rd_p=26a5c67f-1a30-486b-bb90-b523ad38d5a0&amp;pf_rd_r=HMD2PN694SZC3TBZAY0G&amp;pd_rd_wg=bHhM8&amp;pd_rd_r=b27684f1-2208-42c8-a644-650286c79264&amp;pd_rd_i=B06VY6FXMM&amp;th=1\">APC 1500VA</a> one, but then was reading that someone had a similar one that wouldn&#39;t hold up when they started their server. I&#39;ve also found some used PR750LCDRTXLU on E-bay, that I was thinking/hoping I would be able to get and use some 12V 10ah lithium batteries in but I&#39;m not sure if that would be enough for when the server and switch start up. </p> <p>Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/user/FaTheArmorShell\"> /u/FaTheArmorShell </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157kx9b/looking_into_ups_for_server_rack/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157kx9b/looking_into_ups_for_server_rack/\">[comments]</a></span>","content_type":"text/html","length":null,"src":null},"links":[{"href":"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157kx9b/looking_into_ups_for_server_rack/","rel":"alternate","media_type":null,"href_lang":null,"title":null,"length":null}],"summary":null,"categories":[{"term":"homelab","scheme":null,"label":"r/homelab","subcategories":[]}],"contributors":[],"published":"2023-07-23T17:36:48Z","source":null,"rights":null,"media":[],"language":null,"base":null},{"id":"t3_157kwjw","title":{"content_type":"text/plain","src":null,"content":"What should I look for when buying a UPS?"},"updated":"2023-07-23T17:36:04Z","authors":[{"name":"/u/bardodev","uri":"https://ud.reddit.com/user/bardodev","email":null}],"content":{"body":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What&#39;s up guys?</p> <p>I&#39;ve got one of these mini lenovos as a media server connected to an external hard disk.

The seller looks verified to me, with a lot of good reviews and seems to sell a lot of UPS&#39;s and server.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/user/DaKi_B\"> /u/DaKi_B </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bqfb/help_picking_a_ups/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bqfb/help_picking_a_ups/\">[comments]</a></span>","content_type":"text/html","length":null,"src":null},"links":[{"href":"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bqfb/help_picking_a_ups/","rel":"alternate","media_type":null,"href_lang":null,"title":null,"length":null}],"summary":null,"categories":[{"term":"homelab","scheme":null,"label":"r/homelab","subcategories":[]}],"contributors":[],"published":"2023-07-23T10:50:44Z","source":null,"rights":null,"media":[],"language":null,"base":null},{"id":"t3_157bpdd","title":{"content_type":"text/plain","src":null,"content":"[Newbie] NAS on proxmox - best configuration for given situation and tips and tricks?"},"updated":"2023-07-23T10:49:06Z","authors":[{"name":"/u/sala81","uri":"https://ud.reddit.com/user/sala81","email":null}],"content":{"body":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/user/sala81\"> /u/sala81 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"/r/Proxmox/comments/157az74/newbie_nas_on_proxmox_best_configuration_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bpdd/newbie_nas_on_proxmox_best_configuration_for/\">[comments]</a></span>","content_type":"text/html","length":null,"src":null},"links":[{"href":"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bpdd/newbie_nas_on_proxmox_best_configuration_for/","rel":"alternate","media_type":null,"href_lang":null,"title":null,"length":null}],"summary":null,"categories":[{"term":"homelab","scheme":null,"label":"r/homelab","subcategories":[]}],"contributors":[],"published":"2023-07-23T10:49:06Z","source":null,"rights":null,"media":[],"language":null,"base":null},{"id":"t3_157bhrw","title":{"content_type":"text/plain","src":null,"content":"Cleaned up the Lack Rack"},"updated":"2023-07-23T10:37:11Z","authors":[{"name":"/u/midmoto","uri":"https://ud.reddit.com/user/midmoto","email":null}],"content":{"body":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bhrw/cleaned_up_the_lack_rack/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_MXt-0n8VXQc-EQ7Q0vFioALFWFITAgVWu4Wf8dThhU.jpg\" alt=\"Cleaned up the Lack Rack\" title=\"Cleaned up the Lack Rack\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Decided to do some re-arranging while installing new Mellanox NICs in my Unraid box and gaming rig (not pictured), here&#39;s the end result!</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p6u83lwq0pdb1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f62cd5bca8f3fd6ac0737fc25ced7bc3167794f7\">https://preview.redd.it/p6u83lwq0pdb1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f62cd5bca8f3fd6ac0737fc25ced7bc3167794f7</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/user/midmoto\"> /u/midmoto </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bhrw/cleaned_up_the_lack_rack/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bhrw/cleaned_up_the_lack_rack/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","content_type":"text/html","length":null,"src":null},"links":[{"href":"https://ud.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/157bhrw/cleaned_up_the_lack_rack/","rel":"alternate","media_type":null,"href_lang":null,"title":null,"length":null}],"summary":null,"categories":[{"term":"homelab","scheme":null,"label":"r/homelab","subcategories":[]}],"contributors":[],"published":"2023-07-23T10:37:11Z","source":null,"rights":null,"media":[{"title":null,"content":[],"duration":null,"thumbnails":[{"image":{"uri":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_MXt-0n8VXQc-EQ7Q0vFioALFWFITAgVWu4Wf8dThhU.jpg","title":null,"link":null,"width":null,"height":null,"description":null},"time":null}],"texts":[],"description":null,"community":null,"credits":[]}],"language":null,"base":null},{"id":"t3_157awnr","title":{"content_type":"text/plain","src":null,"content":"ROMED8-2T ESXI 8.0U1 compatibility"},"updated":"2023-07-23T10:04:53Z","authors":[{"name":"/u/ThatFeature3175","uri":"https://ud.reddit.com/user/ThatFeature3175","email":null}],"content":{"body":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Am I right in thinking this board is not compatible?
