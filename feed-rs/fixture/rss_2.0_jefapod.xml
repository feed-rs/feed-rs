	The
	<a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a>
	is a wonderful web site that puts up a different astronomy-related
	picture every day.
	However, the site does not have an RSS feed.
	This page fixes that deficiency.

<title>Venus, Moon, and the Smoking Mountain</title>

<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/home/">Venus has returned</a> 
as a <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230826.html">brilliant morning star</a>.

From a window seat on a flight to Mexico City,
the bright celestial beacon was captured just before sunrise in
this astronomical snapshot, taken on September 12.

Venus, at the upper right, shared the early predawn skies
with an <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210710.html">old crescent Moon</a>.

Seen from this stratospheric perspective, both mountain peaks and
clouds appear in silhouette along a glowing eastern horizon.

The dramatic, long, low cloud bank was created by venting
from planet Earth's active volcano

<title>NGC 7331 and Beyond</title>

Big, beautiful spiral galaxy
<a href="http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n7331.html">NGC 7331</a>
is often touted as an analog to our own
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080606.html">Milky Way</a>.

About 50 million light-years distant in the northern constellation
<a href="http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/peg/index.html">Pegasus</a>,
NGC 7331 was recognized early on as
a spiral nebula and is actually one of the brighter
<a href="http://www.seasky.org/cosmic/sky7a07.html">galaxies</a>
<i>not</i> included in Charles Messier's
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/explore-the-night-sky-hubble-s-messier-catalog-bio">famous</a>
18th century catalog.

Since the galaxy's disk
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040701.html">is inclined</a> to our line-of-sight, long
telescopic exposures often result in images that evokes a strong
sense of depth.

The effect is further enhanced
<a href="https://www.astrobin.com/6xa02f/">in this sharp image</a>
by galaxies that lie beyond the gorgeous
<a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Gordon/Gordon2.html">island universe</a>.

The most prominent background galaxies are about one tenth the
<a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale.html">apparent size</a>
of NGC 7331 and so lie roughly ten times farther away.

Their close alignment on the sky with NGC 7331
occurs just by chance.

Lingering above
the plane of the Milky Way, this striking visual grouping of galaxies is
known to some as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7331_Group">Deer Lick Group</a>.

<title> APOD: 2023 September 13 – NGC 4632: Galaxy with a Hidden Polar Ring    </title>
Galaxy NGC 4632 hides a secret from optical telescopes. 

It is surrounded by a ring of cool 
<a href="https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml">hydrogen</a> 
gas orbiting at 90 degrees to its spiral disk. 

Such <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990510.html">polar ring galaxies</a> 
have previously been discovered using starlight. 

However, NGC 4632 is among the first in which a 
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves">radio</a> 
<a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/radio-telescopes/">telescope</a> survey revealed a polar ring. 

The <a href="https://youtu.be/dkMr-D2719w">featured composite image</a> 
combines this gas ring, observed with the highly sensitive 
<a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/atnf/askap-radio-telescope"
>ASKAP telescope</a>, with optical data from the 
<a href="https://subarutelescope.org/">Subaru telescope</a>. 

Using <a href="https://images.nasa.gov/details/ARC-1992-AC89-0437-6"
>virtual reality</a>, astronomers separated out the 
gas in the main disk of the galaxy from the ring, 
and the subtle color gradient traces its orbital motion. 

Why do 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar-ring_galaxy">polar rings</a> exist? 

They could be material 
<a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/dog-playing-tug.jpg"
>pulled</a> from one galaxy as it 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190811.html">gravitationally interacts</a> with a companion. 

Or hydrogen gas flows along the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-H3WzaewdY"
>filaments of the cosmic web</a> and accretes into a ring around a galaxy, 
some of which gravitationally contracts into stars.

<title>Galaxy Cluster Abell 370 and Beyond</title>

Some 4 billion light-years away, massive galaxy cluster Abell 370
is captured in this sharp
<a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2017/20/4024-Image.html">Hubble Space Telescope snapshot</a>.

The cluster of galaxies only
appears to be dominated by two giant elliptical galaxies
and infested with faint arcs.

In reality, the fainter, scattered bluish arcs, along with the
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160828.html">dramatic dragon arc</a>
below and left of center, are images of galaxies that lie
far beyond Abell 370.

About twice as distant, their otherwise undetected light is
magnified and distorted by the cluster's enormous gravitational mass,
overwhelmingly dominated by unseen
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Galaxy_clusters">dark matter</a>.

Providing a
<a href="http://webbtelescope.org/">tantalizing glimpse</a>
of galaxies in the early universe, the effect is known as gravitational
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151127.html">lensing</a>.

A consequence of warped
<a href="http://www.black-holes.org/">spacetime</a>, lensing was
predicted by Einstein almost a century ago.

<a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/videos/2017/20/953-Video.html">Far beyond</a>
the spiky foreground Milky Way star at lower right,
Abell 370 is seen toward the constellation Cetus, the Sea Monster.

It was the last of six galaxy clusters imaged in the
<a href="https://frontierfields.org/">Frontier Fields</a> project.

<title> APOD: 2023 September 11 – Beautiful Comet Nishimura  </title>
This scene would be beautiful even without the comet.

By itself, the 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220924.html">sunrise sky</a> is an elegant deep blue on high, 
with faint white stars peeking through, while near the horizon is a

By itself, the foreground hills of eastern

<title> APOD: 2023 September 10 – An Annular Solar Eclipse over New Mexico   </title>
What is this person doing? 

In 2012, an annular eclipse of the Sun was visible over a 
<a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2012May20Agoogle.html"
>narrow path</a> that crossed the northern Pacific Ocean and 
<a href="https://stardate.org/content/ring-fire">several western US states</a>. 

In an annular solar 
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/eclipses-and-transits-overview"
>eclipse</a>, the Moon is too far from the Earth to 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170301.html">block out</a> the entire Sun, leaving the Sun 
<a href="https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/2022/10/gettyimages-696166057.jpg"
>peeking out</a> over the Moon's disk in a 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130509.html">ring of fire</a>. 

To capture this 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtkoAlwIpWY"
>unusual solar event</a>, an industrious photographer drove from 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona">Arizona</a> to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</a> 
to find just the right vista.

After setting up and just as the 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120522.html">eclipsed Sun</a> was setting over a ridge about 0.5 kilometers away, a person unknowingly walked right into the shot.

Although grateful for the unexpected human element, the photographer 
never learned the identity of the 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160501.html">silhouetted</a> interloper.

It appears likely that the person is holding a circular 
<a href="http://www.mreclipse.com/Totality2/TotalityCh11.html">device</a> 
that would enable them to get their own view of the eclipse.

<a href="http://www.cp-pics.com/p533893218/h4d180eaa#h4d180eaa">The shot</a> 
was taken at sunset on 2012 May 20 at 7:36 pm local time from 
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2167595/Stunning-image-shows-boy-watching-solar-eclipse--taken-1-5-miles-away.html">a park</a> near 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPkaLjssP54">Albuquerque</a>. 

Next month, on October 14, a different narrow swath across 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas"
>North and South America</a> will be exposed to a 
<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eclipses/2023/oct-14-annular/where-when/"
>different annular solar eclipse</a>, if the sky is clear.

Simultaneously, cloud-free observers 
almost anywhere on either continent will be able to see a 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210628.html">partial solar eclipse</a>.

<title> APOD: 2023 September 9 – Comet Nishimura Grows   </title>
Comet Nishimura is growing.

More precisely, the tails 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_P1_(Nishimura)">C/2023 P1 (Nishimura)</a> 
are growing as it nears the Sun.

Discovered only last month, the 
<a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/">comet</a> is already near 
naked eye brightness as it now moves inside the Earth's orbit. 

The comet will be nearest the 
<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/"
>Earth</a> next week, but nearest the Sun the week after -- on September 17. 

Speculation holds that expelled ice and dust from

<title>Star Factory Messier 17</title>

<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030821.html">Sculpted by</a> stellar winds and radiation,
the star factory known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_17">Messier 17</a>
lies some 5,500 light-years away in the nebula-rich constellation
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sgr/index.html">Sagittarius</a>.

At that distance, this 1/3 degree wide field of view spans over

<title>The Large Cloud of Magellan</title>

The 16th century Portuguese navigator
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a> and his crew had plenty of time to study the 
southern sky during the
<a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1519magellan.html">first circumnavigation</a> of planet Earth.

As a result, two fuzzy cloud-like
objects easily visible to southern hemisphere 
skygazers are known as the
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060809.html">Clouds of Magellan</a>, now understood to be
satellite galaxies of our much larger, spiral Milky Way galaxy.

About 160,000 light-years distant in the constellation
Dorado, the
<a href="http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/lmc.html">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>
is seen in this
<a href="https://www.cwastrophotography.com/the-large-magellanic-cloud-lmc">sharp galaxy portrait</a>.

Spanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is
the most massive of the Milky Way's
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/sattelit.html">satellite galaxies</a>
and is the home of the 
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/04/">closest supernova</a> in modern times, 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170305.html">SN 1987A</a>. 

The prominent patch above center is 30 Doradus,
also known as the magnificent
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090916.html">Tarantula Nebula</a>, a giant 
star-forming region about 1,000 light-years across.

<title> APOD: 2023 September 6 – HESS Telescopes Explore the High Energy Sky  </title>
They may look like modern mechanical dinosaurs, but they are enormous swiveling eyes that watch the sky.

The 
<a href="https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/about/telescopes/"
>High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Observatory</a> 
is composed of four 12-meter reflecting-mirror telescopes surrounding a 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120727.html">larger telescope</a> housing a 28-meter mirror.

They are designed to detect strange flickers of blue light -- 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation">Cherenkov radiation</a> 
--emitted when 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle">charged particles</a> move slightly faster than the

<title> APOD: 2023 September 5 – Blue Supermoon Beyond Syracuse </title>
The last full moon was doubly unusual.

First of all, it was a 
<a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/"
>blue moon</a>. 

A modern definition of a 
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/astronomy/item/what-is-a-blue-moon-is-it-ever-really-blue/">blue moon</a> is a second full moon to occur during one 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">calendar</a> month. 

Since there are 13 full moons in 2023, one month has to have two -- and that month was August. 

The first full moon was on August 1 and named a 
<a href="https://www.fullmoonology.com/full-moon-calendar-2023/"
>Sturgeon Moon</a>.

The second reason that the last full moon was 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220704.html">unusual</a> was because it was a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon">supermoon</a>. 

A modern definition of

>supermoon</a> is a moon that reaches its full 
<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/676/phases-of-the-moon/"

<a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5048">appears</a> 
a bit larger and brighter than average.

<title> APOD: 2023 September 4 – Cygnus: Bubble and Crescent</title>
As stars die, they create clouds. 

Two stellar death clouds of gas and dust 
can be found toward the high-flying constellation of the Swan (Cygnus)
as they <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150819.html">drift through</a>
rich star fields in the plane of our 
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html"
>Milky Way Galaxy</a>.

Caught here within the
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvNSVbhsXYs/">telescopic
field of view</a> are the
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150113.html">Soap Bubble</a> (lower left) and the
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210617.html">Crescent Nebula</a> (upper right).

Both were formed at the final phase in the life of a star.

Also known as NGC 6888,
the Crescent Nebula was shaped as its bright, central massive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star">Wolf-Rayet
star</a>, WR 136, shed its outer envelope in
a strong stellar wind.

Burning through fuel at a prodigious rate, WR 136 is near the end of
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/hubble-view-wolf-rayet-stars-intense-and-short-lived">a short life</a>
that should finish in a spectacular
<a href="https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY">supernova</a> explosion.

<a href="http://www.starimager.com/Image%20Gallery%20Pages/Hydrogen%20Alpha%20Images/ic%201318_AP_8%20pane%20mosaic_bubble%20nebula.htm">
Discovered in 2013</a>, the Soap Bubble Nebula is likely a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula">planetary
nebula</a>, the final shroud of a lower mass, long-lived, Sun-like star
destined to become a slowly cooling white dwarf.

Both stellar nebulas are about 5,000 
<a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/">light-years</a> 
distant, with the larger Crescent Nebula 
<a href="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1170788685/photo/jumping-cat.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=_Ot_m-qULa-AS2ueDMH8Qc4vu8jdsNso2hzIxsVGjTw=">spanning</a> about 25 light-years across.

Within a few million years, both will likely have dispersed.

<title> APOD: 2023 September 3 – Comet Schwassmann Wachmann 3 Fragments</title>
Periodic comet
<a href="http://cometography.com/pcomets/

A <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050915.html">cosmic souffle</a>
of ice and dust left over from the early
solar system, this comet was first 
<a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2016/news-2016-35.html"
>seen to split</a> into several large pieces
during the close-in part of its orbit in 1995. 

However, <a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/press-releases/comet-schwassmann-wachmann-3-at-its-best/">in the 2006 passage</a>, it disintegrated into
dozens of fragments that stretched several degrees across the sky.

Since 
<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/overview/"
>comets</a> are relatively fragile, stresses from heat, gravity
and outgassing, for example, could be responsible for their

<title>NGC 7023: The Iris Nebula</title>

These cosmic clouds have blossomed 1,300 light-years away
in the fertile starfields of the
<a href="http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cep/index.html">constellation Cepheus</a>.

Called the Iris Nebula,
<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/17597/ngc-7023-iris-from-the-dust-by-kent-wood/">NGC 7023</a>
is not the only nebula
to evoke the imagery <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080214.html">of flowers</a>.

Still, this
<a href="https://fenyeslorand.hu/irisz_ngc7023/">deep telescopic image</a>
shows off the Iris Nebula's range of
colors and symmetries embedded in surrounding
fields of interstellar dust.

Within the Iris itself, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot,
young star.

The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue,
characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight.

<a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic0915/">Central
filaments</a>
of the reflection nebula glow with a faint reddish
photoluminescence as some dust grains

complex carbon molecules known as
<a href="https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/feature07-03-spitzer-learns-about-carbons-cosmic-life">PAHs</a>.

<title>The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules</title>

<a href="http://messier.seds.org/xtra/similar/halley_pt.html">In 1716</a>,
English astronomer
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/halley_edmond.shtml">Edmond Halley</a>
noted, "This is but a little Patch, but it shows itself to the naked Eye, when
the Sky is serene and the Moon absent."

<a href="http://messier.seds.org/m/m013.html">Of course, M13</a>
is now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in
Hercules, one of the brightest
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster">globular

<a href="https://www.astrobin.com/mxfret/C/">Sharp telescopic views like
this one</a>
reveal the spectacular cluster's
<a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/gobs-of-globs-guide-to-16-spring-globular-clusters/">hundreds of thousands of stars.</a>

At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the
<a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2008/news-2008-40.html">cluster stars crowd</a>
into a region 150 light-years in diameter.

<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031213.html">Approaching</a> the cluster core, 
upwards of 100 stars could be contained
in a cube just 3 light-years on a side.

For comparison, the
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160825.html">closest star</a> to the Sun is over
4 light-years away.

The remarkable range of brightness
recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core.

<title>Full Moons of August</title>

<a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/diy-moon-orbit/">Near perigee</a>,
the closest point in its almost moonthly orbit,
a Full Moon rose as the Sun set on August 1.

Its brighter than average lunar disk was captured in this
dramatic moonrise sequence over dense cloud banks along the
eastern horizon from Ragusa, Sicily.

Illuminating night skies around planet Earth it was the second
<a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-a-supermoon/">supermoon of 2023</a>.

Yet again near perigee, the third supermoon of 2023 will also
<a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/news/196/the-next-full-moon-is-a-supermoon-the-sturgeon-moon/">shine on an August night</a>.

Rising as the Sun sets tonight
this second Full Moon in August will be known to some as a Blue Moon,
even though scattered sunlight gives the lunar disk a reddened hue.

Defined as the second full moon in a calendar month,
<a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/when-is-the-next-blue-moon/">blue moons</a>
occur only once every 2 or 3 years.

That's because lunar phases take 29.5 days,
almost a calendar month, to go through a complete cycle.

<a href="https://earthsky.org/tonight/full-blue-moon-near-saturn-supermoon-august-30-31-2023/">Tonight an August Blue Moon</a>

The differences between M66's

<title> APOD: 2023 August 28 – Star Formation in the Pacman Nebula  </title>
Look through the cosmic cloud cataloged as NGC 281
and you might miss the stars of open cluster
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AJ....113.2116G/abstract"
>IC 1590</a>.

Formed
<a href="https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/ngc281/">within
the nebula</a>, that cluster's young, massive stars
ultimately power the pervasive nebular glow.

The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured 
portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule">Bok globules</a>
seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and 
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves">radiation</a>
from the hot cluster stars.

If they survive long enough,
the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation.

<a href="http://www.google.com/pacman/">Playfully called</a>
the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape,
NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/">Cassiopeia</a>.

This sharp composite image was made through

It combines emission from the nebula's hydrogen 
and oxygen atoms to

<title>Crescents of Venus</title>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei#Phases_of_Venus">Just as the Moon goes</a>
through phases, Venus' visible sunlit hemisphere
<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/482/galileos-phases-of-venus-and-other-planets/">waxes and wanes</a>.

This sequence of
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/194524290@N05/53120589281/">telescopic
images</a>
illustrates the steady changes for Venus during
its recent 2023 apparition as our evening star.

Gliding along its interior orbit between Earth and Sun, Venus grows
larger during that period because it is approaching planet Earth.

Its crescent narrows though, as the inner planet swings closer to our
line-of-sight to the Sun.

Closest to the Earth-Sun line but passing about 8 degrees south of the
Sun, on August 13 Venus reached its (non-judgmental)

And now Venus shines above the eastern horizon in
predawn skies, completing its transition to planet Earth's
<a href="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-424/ch1.htm">morning star</a>.

On August 21, NASA's Parker Solar Probe completed its sixth
gravity assist flyby of Venus, using the encounter to maneuver
the probe toward its

<title>A Season of Saturn</title>

<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/">Ringed planet Saturn</a>
will be at its 2023 opposition,
opposite the Sun in Earth's skies, on August 27.

While that puts the sixth planet from the Sun at its
<a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/saturn-at-opposition-closest-brightest-best/">brightest and well-placed</a>
for viewing, its beautiful ring system isn't
visible to the unaided eye.

Still, this sequence of telescopic images taken a year
apart over the last six years
follows both Saturn and rings as seen from inner planet Earth.

The gas giant's <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210919.html">ring plane tilts</a>
from most open in 2018 to approaching edge-on in 2023 (top to bottom).

That's summer to nearly the autumn
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091110.html">equinox for Saturn's</a> northern hemisphere.

In the sharp planetary portraits, Saturn's northern
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230618.html">hexagon</a> and a large
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110119.html">storm</a> system are clearly visible in 2018.

In 2023, <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170205.html">ice moon Tethys</a>
is transiting, casting its shadow across
southern hemisphere cloud bands, while
Saturn's cold blue south pole is emerging
from almost a decade of winter darkness.
